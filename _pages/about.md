I am an experienced engineering leader with expertise in growth and machine learning. I have been the single-threaded owner of business critical products leading teams of client, backend and machine learning engineers and managers across multiple Geo locations. I have track records in successfully driving user and community growth in Social Media Platform and E-commerce, and 10+ years of industry experience in building and shipping ML-driven applications including large-scale recommendation systems, growth notification/email/sms, search engine marketing, and risk management.

Currently, I am a senior engineering manager and the single-threaded leader of Friending product at **[Snap](https://www.snap.com/)**. We build features to improve Friending experience, combat friending spam, and enhance machine learning systems to generate more relevant and timely friend recommendations for our users. Before Snap, I have worked as a senior applied scientist and tech lead at **[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)**, where I lead a team of scientists and engineers to forecast sales velocity for various promotions and rank recommendations on Seller Central homepage for selling partners. Before joining Amazon, I was a research tech lead at **[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/)** where our team built machine learning solutions for the search engine marketing on Google and Facebook to maximizes the return-over-investment.

I also have a passion in teaching and helping more people into the field of machine learning and data science. Between 2018 and 2023, I taught several Machine Learning courses in **[the Foster School of Business](https://foster.uw.edu/)** at University of Washington, including Advanced ML, Deep Learning and Big Data, and Natural Language Processing.

I received my Ph.D in [Computer Science](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) from [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) working with [Dr. Weng-Keen Wong](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~wongwe/). During the Ph.D. study, my research focused on using probabilistic graphical models and crowdsourcing to predict species distribution using citizen science data and quantify the skill level of citizen scientists in the [eBird project](https://ebird.org/home). Please refer to the publication page for details.
