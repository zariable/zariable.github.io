Hi. My name is Jun Yu. I started this blog with the goal of recording a few of the lessons Iâ€™ve learned in my life. They ranges from learnings from work, retrospective in parenting, thoughts from reading a book, or sometimes just "random walk/thought". I use the term "Gradient" to describe a lession which may sound nerdy, but I find learning life lessions is similar to how gradient descent works in machine learning. They both involve making changes to the path in optimizing for the best outcome (or the global optimal). Plus, I guess I am nerdy inside. Lastly, these posts are really just for myself in recording some of my learnings in seeing the world. This way I can be truthful with myself and do not have to fight the desire to make myself look better.
