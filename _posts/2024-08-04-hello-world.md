Hi. My name is Jun Yu. I started this blog with the goal of recording a few of the lessons Iâ€™ve learned in my life. They ranges from learnings from work, retrospective in parenting, thoughts from reading a book, or sometimes just "random walk/thought" as I live in the moment. I like to use the term "Gradient" to describe a lession which may sound nerdy but I found learning a hard lession is similar to how gradient descent works in finding either global or local optimimal points. Lastly, these gradients are more for myself rather than others, cause this way I can be truthful with myself in recording and do not have to fight the desire to make myself look better.
