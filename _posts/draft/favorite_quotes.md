## [10 ways to have a constructive conversation](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation?referrer=playlist-the_most_popular_talks_of_all)

- Don't multitask. Don't be half in and half out of it. Be present.
- Don't pontificate. Open for feedback and pushback. Assume you have something to learn.
Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.
- Use simple questions instead of complicated one. Use "how does it feel?" rather than "are you happy?"
- Go with the flow. Thoughts come to your mind and let them go out of your mind.
- If you don't know, say you don't know.
- Don't equate your experience with theirs. All experience are individuals. Conversations are not promotion opportunities.
- Don't repeat your conversations.
- Stay out of the weeds/details.
- Listen. If your mouth is open, you are not listening. Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.
- Be brief. Be prepared to be amazed.
