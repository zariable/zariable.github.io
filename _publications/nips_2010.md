Citizen science presents opportunities for crowdsourcing to produce new sources of data that were previously unavailable and even unimaginable. While engaging distributed observer networks is a well-established method for collecting spatiotemporally diverse observational data, ensuring data quality remains a key concern. Related problems of observer reliability, scalability of data verification processes, geospatial biases of observations, and motivating participation are central challenges for citizen science. This paper describes a multidisciplinary strategy for addressing these concerns in eBird through the development of a human-computer learning network.
